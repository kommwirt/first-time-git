    <h1>Pet Names</h1>
    <p>
      Plenty of my friends have developed nicknames with their romantic
      partners. I asked the question on Facebook and got a broad assortment of
      answers: There’s a husband and wife called “Nerk(le) and (Milk)Dud,” a
      dating couple called “Sweefy and Darsh,” and former boyfriends who knew
      each other as “Tiger and Teddy.” An American man who dated a Chinese woman
      told me he called her “Popo,”,which means “wife” or “broken broken,”
      depending on your intonation – and she called him “Benben,” which he says
      means something like “dumb dumb,” referring to his lackluster mastery of
      the Chinese language at the time.
